# Learning Face Recognition

This repository is my open source files for learning/working on different algorithm for face detection.

## Skills

With this project, I attended to learn some tools/skills for professional use:

* React.js
* HTML5/CSS/JS
* Github Pages (Personal use for more projects to come)
* ~~Backend~~

## Experience

This was roughly my second attempt at a protfolio website using react.js for the front-end. I wanted to learn more about the back-end tools but that will be its own project.

## Future
* Redesign the project list
* Reformat the code for responsive layout
* Reformat the font-size to be responsive
* Animate different project's card when selected
* Navbar smooth transition
* Create a skill only section
