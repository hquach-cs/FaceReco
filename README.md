# Learning Face Recognition

This repository is my open source files for learning/working on different algorithm for face Reconition. My end goal would be a better understanding of different algorithm for face recognition.

## Getting Started

This section discuss some library that is needed and how to run most scripts. If you are running videos scripts, you will need a video cam.

### Libraries/Modules
* Numpy
* Opencv-python
* face_recognition
* matplotlib
* skimage

## Skills
List of Algorithms:
* Histogram of oriented gradients
* Haarcascade
* Neural Network (using [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition))

## Experience



## Future
